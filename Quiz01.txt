1. A single byte is made of 8 bits. So how many values can be represented by a single Byte? 
A byte is 8 digits where each can be a 0 or a 1. This means that there are 256, or 2^8 different values represented in a byte.

2. Which type of error results in the C# compiler not compiling the code? (Select one: Logical, Syntax, Runtime)
Syntax. The compiler can only translate a program if the program is syntactically correct; otherwise,
the compilation fails and you will not be able to run your program.(ThinkSharp, 2014)

3. Show the full path of the executable file of your "Hello world" program on your own computer.
C:\Users\user\source\repos\ConsoleApp3\ConsoleApp3\Hello_World.cs

4. Debugging
Using Systems
namespace CSC205Quiz01
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("I just removed all the bugs!");
        }
    }
}

5. Select all the valid C# identifiers:   String, my-age, 3rdNum, dynamic, __num, M&M, @void, var
Identifiers are user-defined name of classes, methods, variables or labels. 
They cannot include keywords such as public, class, and void. These words will be displayed in another color. 
I checked the list by trying to define each as a variable.
Valid identifiers are: String, dynamic, __num, @void, var
