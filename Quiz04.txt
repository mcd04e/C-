1. Read the following program and explain what it does. No need to explain every line of code except those inside the for loop. 

using System;
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int n1 = 0, n2 = 1, n3, i, number;
        Console.Write("Enter a positive integer: ");
        number = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.Write(n1 + " " + n2 + " ");
        for (i = 2; i < number; i++)
        {
            n3 = n1 + n2;
            Console.Write(n3 + " ");
            n1 = n2;
            n2 = n3;
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
}

The program is a loop, incrementing int n1(0) and n2(1) the number of times the user designates with the integer inputted (number).
Those incremented integers are then printed to the console.
The 1st line of the for loop sets int i=2, the for loop set to repeat until int i is not less than the user input (number).
The 2nd line sets n3=n1+n2...to (number).
The 3rd line writes n3 and a ""...to (number).
The 4th line sets n1 to the value of n2.
The 5th line sets n2 to the value of n3.

2. Describe the program below.
using System;
public class Program
{
    public static void DoSomething(string str)
    {
        int i = str.Length - 1;
        while (i >= 0)
        {
            Console.Write($"{str[i]}");
            i--;
        }
        Console.Write("\n");
    }
    public static void Main()
    {
        DoSomething("abcba");
    }
}

The program uses DoSomething method to accept a string of characters from the Main method, 
enumerates the characters with an array (minus one to account for 0), 
and prints the characters backwards using a descending incrementation of int i.
