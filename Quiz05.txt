1. For each of the following methods, write one sentence that describes
abstractly what the method does. For each variable, identify the role it plays.
public static int Banana(int[] a) //Takes an array of integers and returns the sum.
{
    int grape = 0;//serves as the array
    int i = 0;//serves as the index
    while (i < a.Length)
    {
        grape = grape + a[i];
        i++;
    }
    return grape;
}
public static int Apple(int[] a, int p)//Traverses the array until the search element is found and returns the traversed portion of the array.
{
    int i = 0;// index
    int pear = 0;//array
    while (i < a.Length)
    {
        if (a[i] == p) pear++;// p is the search element
        i++;
    }
    return pear;
}
public static int Grapefruit(int[] a, int p)//Traverses the array to search for an element and returns the index where it appears. 
//Failed search returns -1. 
{
    for (int i = 0; i < a.Length; i++)//int i is the index
    {
        if (a[i] == p) return i;//int p is the searched element.
    }
    return -1;
}


2. Create a class called Car that has the following private fields:
	vin - a string representing the vehicle identification number
	make - a string representing the make of the car (such as Ford etc.)
	model - a string representing the model of the car
	mileage - an integer representing the current mileage of the car
The class contains at least two constructors and the following two methods:
	void Drive(int miles) - this method should increase the mileage of the car
	void Display() - this method would display to the user the values of all the fields listed above
In the Main method, create two different cars (Car objects), call the Drive method on each one, for different number of miles, 
and call the Display method for each car.
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace car
{
	public class Car
	{
		private string vin;
		private string make;
		private string model;
		private int mileage;

		public Car(string vn, string mk, string mdl, int mil)
		{
			vin = vn;
			make = mk;
			model = mdl;
			mileage = mil;
		}

		public static void Main(String[] args)
		{
			Car c = new Car("ABC123", "Toyota", "Camry", 50000);
			Car d = new Car("XYZ789", "Honda", "Civic", 20000);
			c.Drive(50000);
            Console.WriteLine(c.Display());
			Console.WriteLine(d.Display());
			Console.WriteLine(c.Drive(50000));
			Console.WriteLine(d.Drive(20000));
		}

		public int Drive(int mileage)
		{
			mileage += 10000;
			return mileage;
		}
		public string Display()
		{
            return vin +" "+ make + " " + model + " " + mileage; 
		}
	}
}
